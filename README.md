# Manual-Face-Attendance-Management-System-Using-CNN

Project Objectives:

  The main objective of our project is, 
•	To detect the attendance from group of images effectively.
•	To train faces using Convolution Neural Network (CNN).
•	To register new students
•	To generate monthly records and view the records.
•	To enhance the overall performance for classification algorithms.
•	To implement the web application.


FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

    The system has different functionalities for an admin and teachers. Admin has higher privileges than teachers. Their functionalities are described below.

Admin Module

   Admin has the highest privileges among all as admin is responsible to design the system. Admin register Lecturer and provide user name and password to the lecturer. They are responsible to take images of the new students and register them to the database. Admin can view and update the details of both students and lecturers. They can also view the attendance report. Admin is also possible to manually add each student attendance and view full record of registered students.
Lecturer Module

   Lecturer can log in to the system. They can open the application and input group image of the students for attendance. They can also view the attendance report. If any student is missing in attendance during recognition,
Lecturer is possible to manually add each student attendance. 

Student Module

    Admin and Lecturer can log in to the system. They can register new student and log in each student account, to modify existing student details.
